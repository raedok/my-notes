My name is **Raad Akour**, I have bachelor degree in Statistics in ***2018***, I finished my master’s degree also in Statistics.
Nowadays, I am learning Python to become a good developer
# ***Paragraph 2***
Firstly its amazing article I learned a lot of things from it, briefly it’s talking about how to be a good developer.
The software purpose is helping people, if we write a system or software with easy way then we are helping people, help people is the scale for classification developers who is good and how is bad .
Software become useful and helpful for people when it has written simple as possible and that fulfill if the developer understand what he doing, so many instructions and advices for developers should do it in writing codes like:

- **avoid** complexity the developer’s job is reduce the complexity not increase it.
- Organize your time smartly.
- Code should be designed based on what you know now not what you think will happen in the future, this rule avoid you many problems in future.
-  **Don’t be shy to ask help for problems and don’t waste your time**.

And there is a lot of instructions and advices but there is a sentence caught my attention

 **"start small, improve it, then extend"**  that is wisdom for building software.
